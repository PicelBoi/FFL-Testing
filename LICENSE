Do anything you want with this code, but please contribute back if you make substantial changes. THIS CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

## EXCEPTIONS

If you are associated with Jonathan Barrow or Pretendo Network in any way, you may NOT make use of or redistrubute this program, unless you follow these terms:

* You or any other member of the Pretendo Network staff team must initiate contact with the author, Arian Kordi, on the social messaging app known as Discord using the username ".arian.", and maintain a substantial conversation with him on the topic of Miis or Mii rendering.
    - You must also search for the keyword "render" in the Discord guild for internal discussion among Pretendo Network staff and send him all of the results. LOL.
* You must reinstate the Pretendo Network account belonging to Arian Kordi one time. The account's username is ".arian." and the issue is that the serial number has been stored as "SW14887987\n". You must remove the erroneous line break. That is all.
* You must mention the software (the FFL-Testing Mii renderer) in at least one official Pretendo Network progress update blog post, one year from when you start using it. In the post, you must mention the authors declared here: Arian Kordi, aboood40091, and make a link to the project's source available.

You are only permitted to publicly deploy or redistribute the software upon successfully initiating a conversation with Arian Kordi, provided he is still alive and responds in 4 business days.
